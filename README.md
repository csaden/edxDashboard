## Dashboard Competition

http://databits.io/challenges/edx-learning-dashboard-challenge

Based on the provided data on video usage and problem performance, create a progress summary that shows a student how they're doing in the context of their peers. Here are some questions a student might want to have answered by looking at their “dashboard”:

### Questions
How far am I in the course? What’s still left?
How have I engaged with the course?
How do I compare to others?
What should I do next?
Am I on track to reach my goal?
What's my current grade?

### Requirements
Use this data to create a visualization aiming to answer question(s) above that you believe are most important.
Allow the user to select a student id from the dataset, to see the data from their perspective.
Show the student’s performance in the context of their peers.

### Recommendations
Interactivity — let the student explore the visualization.
Clustering — group the students in some way(s), and use the grouping to intelligently reveal information on comparison to other students in an individual’s performance dashboard.
Mobile friendliness — anything we actually ship will need to work on phones and tablets.
D3 and other packages are acceptable.
